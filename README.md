This repository contains the projects for MVA's course: Object recognition and computer vision 2017/2018

Here is the class website: http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/teaching/recvis17/

We did 3 project with a few implementations (not present in this repo) in order to understand some basics of the field :

HW1: Instance-level recognition (SIFT features, descriptors, projection formula...)
HW2: Image classification (Precision Recall,  SVM, BoVW, FV- Vlad Encoding
HW3: Neural networks 

In the final project we have studied the article in a team composed by Othmane Sayem and Pirashanth Ratnamogan:
Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Zhu et al.)
